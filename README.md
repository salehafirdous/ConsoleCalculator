# Task 1: Console Calculator

This project is part of my **Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship**.  
The objective is to build a **basic calculator** using Java console input/output.


## Project Structure
- Base package: `com.elevatelabs.tasks`
- Each task is represented as a **Java class** inside this package.
- Example:
com.elevatelabs.tasks
├── ConsoleCalculator.java (Task 1)
├── xyz.java (Task 2)
├── xyz.java (Task 3)
└── ...


## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Handles divide-by-zero
- Allows multiple calculations until user exits
- Uses `Scanner` for input
- Uses methods, loops, and conditionals


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
 ```bash`
 git clone <your-repo-link>
2. Open the project in Eclipse (or any IDE).
3. Run the file: ConsoleCalculator.java

## Concepts Learned:
Java methods
Conditionals
Loops (while, switch)
Scanner for input
Error handling (division by zero)

## File Structure
