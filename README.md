# Task 1: Console Calculator

This project is part of my **Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship**.  
The objective is to build a **basic calculator** using Java console input/output.

## Description
This is a simple Java console-based calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Structure
- Base package: `com.elevatelabs.tasks`
- Each task is represented as a **Java class** inside this package.
  
- Example:
com.elevatelabs.tasks
├── ConsoleCalculator.java (Task 1)
├── xyz.java (Task 2)
├── xyz.java (Task 3)
└── ...

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Handles divide-by-zero
- Allows multiple calculations until user exits
- Uses `Scanner` for input
- Uses methods, loops, and conditionals


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
 ```bash`
 git clone <your-repo-link>
2. Open the project in Eclipse (or any IDE).
3. Run the file: ConsoleCalculator.java

## Concepts Learned:
1) Java methods
2) Conditionals
3) Loops (while, switch)
4) Scanner for input
5) Error handling (division by zero)

## File Structure
com.elevatelabs.tasks
 └── ConsoleCalculator.java
